It's Pong.
Use W and S keys to control the left paddle and the Up and Down arrow keys to control the right paddle. There's no win condition, just go until you get bored I suppose.

For fun I decided to make it so that you can resize the window to any relatively normal number and it should still work. Just change the line of code that sets the window size. I tested at 600x400 and 300x100 and it works well. The only things to note are that the text doesn't seem to be scalable and the velocity of the ball and paddles will always be hard-set because I can't do any more math. My brain will explode. Thank you.

Also there's no code comments this time. I don't like adding code comments after I've already finished writing code but I might do it later.
